    "Q1. What is multiprocessing in Python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is a module in Python that allows the creation and management of multiple processes. Each process runs in its own Python interpreter with its own memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usefulness:\n",
    "True Parallelism: It bypasses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) so that multiple processes can run in parallel on different CPU cores, making it ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Isolation: Each process is isolated, which can prevent issues that arise from shared state.\n",
    "Improved Performance: For heavy computations, using multiple processes can significantly reduce execution time compared to single-threaded or multithreaded approaches in CPU-bound scenarios."

    "GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)\t\n",
    "Bypasses the GIL; processes run truly in parallel on multiple CPU cores.\tSubject to the GIL in CPython; limits parallel execution of CPU-bound threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overhead\t\n",
    "Higher overhead due to process creation and inter-process communication.\tLower overhead since threads are lighter weight than processes.\n",
