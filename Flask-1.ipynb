    "Flask is a micro web framework that follows the \"micro\" philosophy, which means it aims to keep the core functionality minimal and provides extensibility through modular extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Simplicity: Flask has a simple and intuitive design that makes it easy to understand and use. It has a small learning curve, making it accessible to beginners and allowing developers to quickly get started with building web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Lightweight and Flexible: Flask is a lightweight framework that does not impose unnecessary dependencies or restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Extensibility: Flask provides a modular structure that encourages the use of extensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "4.Integrated Development Server: Flask comes with a built-in development server that makes it convenient for developers to test and debug their applications during the development process. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.Python Integration: Flask is built with Python and seamlessly integrates with Python libraries and tools. This allows developers to leverage the rich Python ecosystem and utilize existing Python knowledge and resources in their Flask applications.\n",
